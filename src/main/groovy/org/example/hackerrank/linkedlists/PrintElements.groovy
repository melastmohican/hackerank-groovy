package org.example.hackerrank.linkedlists

/**
 * Given a pointer to the head node of a linked list, print its elements in order, one element per line. If the head pointer is null (indicating the list is empty), donâ€™t print anything.

 Input Format

 The void print(Node* head) method takes the head node of a linked list as a parameter. Each struct Node has a data field (which stores integer data) and a next field (which points to the next element in the list).

 Note: Do not read any input from stdin/console. Each test case calls the print method individually and passes it the head of a list.

 Output Format

 print the integer data for each element of the linked list to stdout/console (e.g.: using printf, cout, etc.). There should be one element per line.

 Sample Input

 This example uses the following two linked lists:

 NULL
 1->2->3->NULL

 NULL and Node 1 are the two head nodes passed as arguments to print(Node* head).

 Note: In linked list diagrams, -> describes a pointer to the next node in the list.

 Sample Output

 1
 2
 3

class PrintElements {
    def printList(Node head) {
        while(head) {
            println head.data
            head = head.next
        }
    }
}
